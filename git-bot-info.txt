Git Bot Overview
================

A Git bot is an automated tool that interacts with Git repositories to perform various tasks without manual intervention.

Key Features:
-------------
1. Automated Commits: Bots can automatically commit changes based on triggers or schedules
2. Git Notes Management: Can add, update, or retrieve git notes for commits
3. CI/CD Integration: Often integrated with continuous integration/deployment pipelines
4. Code Review Assistance: Can automate parts of the code review process
5. Repository Maintenance: Helps with tasks like branch cleanup, tagging, and more

Git Notes Bot:
--------------
This project specifically focuses on managing Git notes - a feature that allows you to attach additional information to commits without modifying the commit itself. Git notes are stored in a separate ref (refs/notes/commits by default) and can be pushed/pulled independently from the main codebase.

Use Cases:
----------
- Adding AI-generated summaries to commits
- Tracking additional metadata for commits
- Creating automated documentation
- Adding review comments or analysis results

Benefits:
---------
- Non-invasive: Doesn't change commit history
- Flexible: Can be added or modified after the fact
- Separate from code: Notes can be managed independently
- Collaborative: Team members can share notes across repositories
