In the garden where the code grows wild,
Where logic flows like rivers mild,
The algorithms dance and play,
Transforming night into the day.

Each function has a tale to tell,
Of loops and branches, working well,
Variables hold their precious state,
While comments help us navigate.

The commit history stands so tall,
A monument to fix them all,
And in the notes, the wisdom lies,
Of lessons learned and compromise.

So let the keyboard softly sing,
As fingers dance and ideas spring,
For in this world of bits and bytes,
We craft our dreams through endless nights.
